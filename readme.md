### Tech stacks:

### Notes:
* There are currently no grad on this team so it is hard to gauge what they will let you do.
* Can't see the PRs they are private

### Pros:
* Has UI/UX frontend work seems to be a fullstack team. (e.g. Bill Wong on the team is doing a lot of frontend https://commbank.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=assignee%20was%20712020%3Aef3dd64a-2902-4116-871b-d6db130259a2%20order%20by%20created%20DESC)
* A lot of Chinese on the team

### Cons:
* Same as the above team there is not a lot of dev work, the staff engineering is doing a lot of analysis work (e.g. Ken Cheng doesn't have a lot of coding tickets https://commbank.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=assignee%20was%2062ac9be6fd38e70069b56b8d%20order%20by%20created%20DESC)

### Example PR:

### Grad currently on the team:
 
## Alistair.MacArthur@cba.com.au Quants, Data, Analytics & Technology Domain

### Tech stacks:
* SOP
* Grafana
* DOTNET? (Because they use prometheus which is for dotnet https://commbank.atlassian.net/issues/IDAP-445?jql=assignee%20was%20712020%3A4b56f743-b2e3-42b5-a270-ea22ea1009c4%20order%20by%20created%20DESC)
* Snowflake
* AWS
* Tableu (e.g. https://commbank.atlassian.net/browse/IB-262)
* Jenkins

### Notes:
* A lot of data and data engineering (because they use snowflake and tableu). 
* They care a lot about security (e.g. https://commbank.atlassian.net/browse/IDAP-314, https://commbank.atlassian.net/browse/IDAP-290)
* Can't see the PRs they are private

### Pros:
* Product owner is probably Chinese background.


### Cons:
* They advertised the role as software but most engineer on the team is a data engineer... Potentially you may roll off into a data engineer
* Not a lot of dev work.

### Tech stacks:
This one really teams on which team...

* Python
* Dotnet
* AWS (DHP)
* config changes yaml (https://github.source.internal.cba/SiteReliabilityEngineering/observability-stack/pull/4288/files)
* Grafana dashboards (https://github.source.internal.cba/SiteReliabilityEngineering/observability-stack/pull/4374/files)

### Notes:
* It is very vague which squad this one is referring to... The team form points to a team not a specific squad. Some squads looks pretty good (e.g. https://cba.teamform.co/teams/WD91TKEH/details)
* Code changes are all pretty small (e.g. https://github.com/CBA-CommBank/term-deposit.update-offer.lambda/pull/1/files)
* Grads are not doing a lot of meaningful work
